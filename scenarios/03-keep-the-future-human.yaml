ScenarioSummary: |
  With the Gates secured, humanity turns to building Tool AI — systems that empower rather than replace.
  Power is redistributed through democratic oversight, scientific integrity, and responsible technology design.

Governments:
  initial_states:
    - Export controls exist but no international treaties on AI compute
  end_states:
    - Negotiate international agreements for verification and enforcement
  gaps:
    - severity: Critical
      explanation: No international treaties or institutions; rivalry (e.g., US–China) intensifies

Corporations:
  initial_states:
    - Employee dissent exists but leadership remains committed to AGI race
  end_states:
    - Respond to cultural and social pressure to change mission
  gaps:
    - severity: Large
      explanation: Some cultural dissent, but weak relative to leadership and profit incentives

HardwareManufacturers:
  initial_states:
    - No global harmonized standards; unilateral controls create loopholes
  end_states:
    - Support global standards without loopholes
  gaps:
    - severity: Large
      explanation: Global standards absent due to geopolitical rivalry

Regulators:
  initial_states:
    - No global AI governance body exists; only proposals for CERN/IAEA-style institutions
  end_states:
    - Create legitimate global governance institutions
  gaps:
    - severity: Critical
      explanation: No international enforcement mechanisms; rival governments do not cooperate

CivilSociety:
  initial_states:
    - Public polls show opposition to AGI but understanding of risks is shallow
  end_states:
    - Be well-informed on AGI risks and Tool AI alternatives
  gaps:
    - severity: Moderate
      explanation: Public instincts align but education and awareness are lacking

ScientificCommunity:
  initial_states:
    - Prominent researchers (Hinton, Bengio) actively warn of extinction risks
  end_states:
    - Engage public and policymakers with credible advocacy
  gaps:
    - severity: Small
      explanation: Advocacy growing and aligned, but not yet mainstreamed
