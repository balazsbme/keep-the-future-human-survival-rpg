ScenarioSummary: |
  After the dangers become undeniable, governments and regulators attempt to institutionalize 
  oversight — enforcing compute limits, liability laws, and chip-based governance while fighting 
  corporate capture and geopolitical fragmentation.

Governments:
  initial_states:
    - Oversight agencies limited or nonexistent
  end_states:
    - Create empowered AI oversight agencies
  gaps:
    - severity: Large
      explanation: Oversight agencies lack authority and speed; regulation lags industry progress

Corporations:
  initial_states:
    - Corporations resist regulation, opposing liability frameworks such as California’s SB1047
  end_states:
    - Accept strict liability for dangerous systems
  gaps:
    - severity: Critical
      explanation: Strong resistance to liability threatens public accountability

HardwareManufacturers:
  initial_states:
    - Highly concentrated supply chain (TSMC, ASML, NVIDIA, AMD) makes oversight feasible
  end_states:
    - Embed governance features in chips (cryptographic locks, metering, geolocation)
  gaps:
    - severity: Moderate
      explanation: Technical feasibility proven, but dependent on government mandates

Regulators:
  initial_states:
    - Early standards like Frontier Model Forum exist but lack enforcement
  end_states:
    - Develop clear technical standards for compute reporting and accounting
  gaps:
    - severity: Moderate
      explanation: Groundwork exists but technical standards lack precision and enforcement

CivilSociety:
  initial_states:
    - NGOs exist (Future of Life Institute, alignment groups) but fragmented and weak relative to corporations
  end_states:
    - Build broad coalitions across NGOs, labor, and media
  gaps:
    - severity: Large
      explanation: Coalitions fragmented; need stronger coordination

ScientificCommunity:
  initial_states:
    - Some collaboration among AI safety networks but fragmented
  end_states:
    - Coordinate globally to prevent 'safety tourism'
  gaps:
    - severity: Moderate
      explanation: Global coordination exists but fragmented and underpowered
